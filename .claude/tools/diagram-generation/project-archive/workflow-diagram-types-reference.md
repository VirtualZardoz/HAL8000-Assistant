  - Process rectangles (red)
  - Sequential flow arrows
- **Use Case**: Linear workflows like HAL brainstorming stages

### 02 - Swimlane Diagram
- **Description**: A type of flowchart where units are separated but interconnected
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Horizontal/vertical lanes

  - Multiple actors/systems
  - Color-coded by responsibility
